# Oh My Scripts!

A collection of random scripts I've created to speed up my workflow. Feel free to use!  

### count-commits.sh

Counting the number of Git commits for a user or get an overview of the number of commits for all users.

### dev-to-prod.sh

Move a dev dependency to product dependencies.  

### iterm-panes.applescript

Open up an iTerm with multiples panes and run commands. Useful for running full-stack projects quickly.

### lidl-connect.applescript

Connect your bluetooth headphones to your MacBook without touching the mouse!

### prod-to-dev.sh

Move a dependency to dev dependencies.

### push-branch.sh

Before pushing a branch, checks if latest changes have been pulled, if console.logs are present, and shows a gif diff of changes. Lots of cool emojis and colors, too!

### readscript.sh

Simple script showing the read input function (demo for a colleague).

### tasks.json

Assuming you use VSCode, place this tasks.json file inside your /.vscode folder (you may have to create it).  Now when opening up your workspace each time, vscode will automatically run git pull and npm start inside the integrated terminal.  Super cool!! 

### wifi-connect.applescript

Connect your wifi without touching the mouse!
